# My Experience at NodeConf 2025

Last week I had the incredible opportunity to attend NodeConf 2025, and it was absolutely worth it. Here are my top takeaways.

## Day 1: The Future of Node.js

The opening keynote focused on Node.js 22 and upcoming features. Some exciting announcements:

- Native TypeScript support (finally!)
- Improved performance benchmarks
- Better built-in testing utilities
- Enhanced security features

## Day 2: Workshop Sessions

I attended several hands-on workshops:

### Performance Optimization
Learned advanced profiling techniques and how to identify bottlenecks in production applications.

### Microservices Architecture
Explored modern patterns for building scalable microservices with Node.js.

### Security Best Practices
Deep dive into protecting Node.js applications from common vulnerabilities.

## Networking

One of the best parts was connecting with other developers from around the world. I met:
- Core Node.js contributors
- Developers from major tech companies
- Fellow freelancers sharing their experiences

## Key Insights

Several themes emerged throughout the conference:

1. **TypeScript is becoming standard** - Almost everyone is using TypeScript for Node.js projects
2. **Serverless is growing** - More teams are adopting serverless architectures
3. **Developer experience matters** - Tools and workflows are getting better
4. **Community is strong** - The Node.js community continues to thrive

## Resources Discovered

I came away with a list of new tools and libraries to explore:
- New testing frameworks
- Performance monitoring tools
- Database ORMs
- Authentication libraries

## Final Thoughts

Conferences like NodeConf remind me why I love being a developer. The community, the innovation, and the shared passion for building great software are inspiring.

Already looking forward to next year!
