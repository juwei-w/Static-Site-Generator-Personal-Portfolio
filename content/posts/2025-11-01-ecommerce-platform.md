# Building a Custom E-Commerce Platform

I'm currently working on an exciting project - a fully custom e-commerce platform for a client in the fashion industry.

## Project Goals

This platform needs to support:
- Product catalog with variants
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Payment processing
- Order management
- Customer accounts
- Admin dashboard

## Progress So Far

Week 1-2: Database design and API architecture
Week 3: Product catalog implementation
Week 4: Shopping cart functionality (current)

## Challenges

Some interesting challenges I'm tackling:
- Inventory management across multiple warehouses
- Real-time stock updates
- Complex product variants (size, color, material)
- Payment gateway integration

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Payment: Stripe
- Frontend: React (client's preference)
- Hosting: AWS

More details coming once the project launches!
